# Recommendation System Deployment with Streamlit and FastAPI

This project demonstrates a content-based recommendation system that suggests similar items using **cosine similarity**. The system is deployed with **FastAPI** as a backend API and **Streamlit** as a user-friendly frontend interface.

## ðŸš€ Overview

The goal of this project is to provide item recommendations based on feature similarity.
The pipeline includes:

* Data preprocessing and similarity computation
* RESTful API deployment with FastAPI
* Interactive web interface with Streamlit
* Integration of frontend and backend for seamless recommendations

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

* **Python 3.9+**
* **scikit-learn / NumPy / Pandas** â€“ similarity computation and data handling
* **FastAPI** â€“ for serving the recommendation API
* **Streamlit** â€“ for frontend UI
* **Uvicorn** â€“ ASGI server to run FastAPI

## âœ¨ Features

* Generate recommendations using **cosine similarity**
* REST API for easy integration with other services
* Clean and interactive frontend with Streamlit
* Modular design for extending to other recommendation techniques
